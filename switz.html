<h1> Switzerland </h1>
<p> We stayed our first night in Geneva, Giles made friends with the swans. </p> </br>

<p> The drive through the alps on the Monday (Giles' birthday!) was definitely the highlight </p>

<p> After <a href="monaco.html" Monaco> </a> we returned to Switzerland, this time to Lucerne, on the evening of the 22nd (Wednesday). We didn't do too much that evening, just tired after the long hot drive (approx. 8 hours in 30C, with air-con barely effective!) so we went and watched some of the Euro football games. Belgum and Ireland both scored late goals at roughly the same time to beat Sweden and Italy, respectively. </p>
